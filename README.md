# PlaTo - Planning To Calendar
This readme briefly describes how to get PlaTo up and running, considering:
1. You have **JAVA_HOME** pointed to `JDK-14` in your environment variables
2. You have installed `NetBeans IDE 12.1`
3. You know how to **pull** this repository, create your own **branch**, and **push** your changes to this branch.

## 1 - JAVA_HOME and JDK-14
Open up a command prompt (Windows+R, type `cmd`, press enter) and check your java version (`java -version` and `javac -version`).

You're good to go if your version is 14.x.x.
Otherwise, [download JDK-14](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and follow the installation process.

Next, type `systemvariables` (or in dutch: `omgevingsvariabelen`), which will lead you to the following screen

## 2 - NetBeans
